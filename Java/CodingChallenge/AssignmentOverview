Below are the specifications of this coding challenge:

Promotional Pricing
Write an application that will calculate the total basket cost for a mix of items.  The pricing logic
should handle the following items and pricing schemes:

 Peaches are 75 cents each.  If you buy 4 or more the price drops to 50 cents each.  
 Avocados are $2 and donâ€™t go on sale.
 Mangos are $2 each but are currently on promotion as buy one get one free.
 
Write a program that can calculate the total basket cost of these items.  The program inputs should
be how many of each item was purchased.  Inputs can come from user input, read from a file,
passed as command-line arguments, Unit Tests, etc.  You can be flexible here.  As long as the
program can be run and inputs can be changed.
